The Challenges of Wearable Computing - Summary

This reading focuses on wearables specifically as compared to the entire
ubiquitous computing domain.

Sufficient power and charging media are still an active domains.
Scavenging user's environment for power and including inductive chargers in it,
is an innovative solution but currently not feasible for production grade
wearables due to high cost associated with it.

Cellular coverage, Wireless access, pre-caching services, memory
and thin client size are already embedded in smartphones today. Its the sheer
amount of data and its interoperability with environments generated by the
smartphone is what we need to think about.

The author addresses the security-privacy design tradeoff. He proposes
physical(shielding), technological (encryption), legislative and social (horcrux
like - saving data in a personal object) ways of increasing security.

Another interesting discussion is about the intellectual tools like Twiddler,
Xerox's Forget Me Not and AR version of Web(3-D Annoting and recognition, Holo
Lens like) which are pretty interesting devices for rapid information capture
and context aware systems respectively.

Even though hardware will be significantly better, there will be a need to
discuss the design constraints to maintain balance between privacy, power,
networking and interface.(AR displays - bulky interface, but power and
networking intensive, Fitbit - minimal interface compensated by long battery
life)

Some Computer Science Issues in Ubiquitous Computing - Summary

This article follows the theme of the previous one, where the author wants to
seamlessly integrate computing prowess in an user's life. He lists the
technological challenges faced by the hardware prototypes he's mentioned in the
earlier article. These constraints are mainly in form of the need to maintain a
balance of multitude of features(communication, memory, multimedia and ports).
He discusses need for modular design to incorporate flexibility.

The author then goes on to describe the problems faced in development of
ubiquitous computing systems. Hardware components face problem of reducing power
consumption with increase in performance which promotes increase in pipelining
and parallelism. He further discusses the importance of redefining network
protocols for incorporating wireless networks. He then focuses on problems in
interface devices such as need for better user interaction, modularity and
migration(cloud computing). Then he has case studies of three applications
developed at Xerox.

He also discusses the problem of privacy with respect to the location and
central processing. He concludes by stating that the research in this domain
will be propelled by the cross domain applications.

The Computer for the 21st Century - Summary

The author states that a technology was reached it's zenith when it becomes a
indistinguishable part of a user's life. Manifests of such technology are
writing and electric motors.

He envisions a future for 'Ubiquitous' computing in the form of pads, tabs and
boards wherein the inter-device interaction and user-device interaction will be
seamless. He wants them to attune to the user who is using them. He also quotes
prototypes of such devices.

Technological advancements required for the author's vision are low power
displays, a flexible network to manage all the interactions and software system
applications. It is astonishing to note his fairly accurate predictions
regarding the displays (LED TVs), storage devices(1TB HDDs are a standard these
days) and micro-kernel OS(Android OS). Although he fails to envision the big
data trend and hence his statement regarding abundant space fails.

He also briefly touches on the need for better cryptographic algorithms for
security and privacy.  He concludes with an example of how the 'connected'
society  would function by showing us a day in the life of a working woman and
the ease with which she interacts with the 'computers' around her.
